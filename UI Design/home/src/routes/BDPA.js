             <h1 className='c2'>Blood Donation Process</h1><br></br>
             <p className='c5'>Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but can make a big difference in the lives of others. The donation process from the time one arrives until the time they leave takes about an hour. The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.</p><br></br>
             <p className='c5'>The steps in the process are:</p><br></br>
             <h2 className='c5'>Donor Questionnaire Fill-up:</h2>

             <p className='e4'>• We will cleanse an area on the arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.</p><br></br>
             <p className='e4'>• There will be some time to relax while the bag is filling. For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. For Platelet Donation, by Apheresis the collection can take up to 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p><br></br>
            <h2 className='c5'><strong>Refreshments</strong></h2><br></br>
            <p className='e5'>• After donating, one should have a snack and something to drink in the refreshments area. Donor can leave the site after 10-15 minutes and continue with the normal daily activities.</p><br></br>

            <h1 className='c2'>Blood Donation Awareness</h1><br></br>
            <h2 className='c5'>Blood life-stream of human body:</h2><br></br>
            <p className='c5'>There is no substitute for blood. Researchers have investigated a number of possible blood substitutes. Even though certain chemicals and some natural substances can carry oxygen, they cannot perform all the functions of natural blood. Blood cannot be manufactured synthetically. The only source of blood & Blood products is still the human body. As long as blood cannot be manufactured, blood transfusion services must depend upon fellow-human beings to save lives.</p><br></br>
            <h2 className='c5'>Body makes up what one donate:</h2><br></br>
            <p className='c5'>The average blood volume in a healthy individual is about 5 to 6 liters.  At every blood donation, roughly about 350/450ml of blood depending on the body weight is collected. Our body compensates this volume replaced within 24 to 48 hours. One can resume normal routine within an hour of donating blood.</p><br></br>
            <h2 className='c5'>You too, can benefit by donating blood:</h2><br></br>
            <p className='c5'>The more the merrier! Frequent blood Donors assure us that they feel physically rejuvenated and mentally more fulfilled after every blood donation.</p><br></br>
            <p className='c5'>There are also reports that it is good to donate blood regularly to prevent some heart diseases.</p><br></br>
            <p className='c5'>In spite of all the above advantages and probably due to lack of awareness about blood donation, still only about 5% of eligible Donors donate blood.</p><br></br>
            <h3 className='c5'><strong>Blood Requirement Circumstances</strong></h3><br></br>
            <ul className='e5'>
